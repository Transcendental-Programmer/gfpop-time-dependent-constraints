# Background

There are many R packages for changepoint detection, which is an important problem in many application domains (genomics, finance, etc). A new changepoint model with up-down constraints has shown state-of-the-art peak detection accuracy in genomic data, and more general models like this can be implemented using the new [gfpop](https://github.com/vrunge/gfpop) package (Runge et al, [arXiv:2002.03646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03646)).

Currently the gfpop package only supports constraints which are valid for all time points. The goal of this project is to extend gfpop to allow constraints which depend on time. This will allow implementing fast optimal solvers for several new constrained changepoint models such as [Labeled Optimal Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13967).

## Related work

Existing R packages fall into two categories:
- generic frameworks such as gfpop, Segmentor3IsBack, changepoint which allow computation of several different types of changepoint models. (but do not allow time dependent constraints)
- domain-specific packages such as LOPART, which computes one model with time dependent constraints (Gaussian loss, label constraints).

## Coding project: time dependent contraints in gfpop

The goal of the coding project would be to extend gfpop to support time dependent constraints, so a wider variety of models could be specified in this framework.

I think the easiest way to implement this from a R/C++ interface perspective would be to:
1. Allow user to pass to gfpop a new "rule" argument, a vector of length N (number of data) with entries that are integers which specify an update rule ID to use for each data point.
2. Add a "rule" argument in the Edge function. This is an integer which should correspond to the IDs provided in 1.

In practice this could be specified via R code like:

```r
LOPART.graph <- gfpop::graph(
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "normal",   type="null", rule=1),
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "normal",   type="std",  rule=1, penalty=5.5),
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "normal",   type="null", rule=2),
    gfpop::Edge("noChange", "noChange", type="null", rule=2),
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "noChange", type="std",  rule=2),
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "normal",   type="std",  rule=3),
    gfpop::Edge("noChange", "normal",   type="null", rule=3),
    gfpop::Edge("normal",   "normal",   type="null", rule=4))
gfpop::gfpop(data.vec, LOPART.graph, rule=data.table::fcase(
    unlabeled, 1,
    in.positive.label, 2,
    end.positive.label, 3,
    in.negative.label, 4))
```

The idea in the code above is that the data.table::fcase call is like a switch statement that returns a vector with elements from 1 to 4 which specify what update rule/graph to use at each data point (variables unlabeled/in.positive.label etc above are logical vectors that depend on the provided label data in the LOPART model).

Then when you compute the DP updates you can, instead of using all of the edges, you can instead just use the subset of edges which correspond to the ruleID of the current data point.

The only tricky part is that we sometimes need to set a cost function to be infinity (if there are no edges coming to it at this data point) and the operators (min-less, min-more, min-env) need to be updated to handle the case of infinite inputs.

The goal for GSOC will be to implement at least:
1. up-down constrained model with label constraints (6 rule IDs).
2. usual changepoint model with 0/1 label constraints (4 rule IDs, shown in R code above).

## Expected impact

The gfpop package is already very useful, and incorporating time-dependent constraints will make it more useful.

## Tests

Do one or several â€” doing more hard tests makes you more likely to be selected.

NOTE: this is a very difficult GSOC project, and so the ideal contributor really should do all tests below. If we can't find a contributor that can do all these tests, we should probably not fund this GSOC project.

### Easy
Write an R function `plotModel` which takes a `gfpop::graph` as above and draws a matrix of nodes (one row for each state, one column for each rule) and edges.

### Medium
The Segmentor3IsBack package implements the segment neighborhood model (best models in 1,...,K segments) for the Poisson loss and no constraints, but there is no implementation available for the optimal partitioning model (best K-segment model for a single penalty parameter, without computing the models with 1,...,K-1 segments). The goal of this test is to modify the code in the `PeakSegOptimal` package, in order to implement a solver for the optimal partitioning problem with Poisson loss and no constraints. Begin by studying [PeakSegFPOPLog.cpp](https://github.com/tdhock/coseg/blob/master/src/PeakSegFPOPLog.cpp) which implements the optimal partitioning model for the Poisson loss and the up-down constraints. There are two states in this model, up and down.  Since the up-down constrained solver has two states, there are N x 2 optimal cost functions to compute (`cost_model_mat` is of dimension `data_count*2`). The cost of being in the up state at `data_i` is `cost_model_mat[data_i]` and the cost of being in the down state is `cost_model_mat[data_i+data_count]`. The `min_prev_cost.set_to_min_less_of(down_cost_prev)` method enforces a non-decreasing constraint between adjacent segment means, for the state change down->up. Analogously, the `PiecewisePoissonLossLog::set_to_min_more_of` method enforces a non-increasing constraint for the state change up->down. To implement the unconstrained solver, you just need to implement a new `PiecewisePoissonLossLog::set_to_unconstrained_min_of` method that computes the minimum constant cost function (one `PoissonLossPieceLog` object), and then uses that to compute the N x 1 array of optimal cost functions (`cost_model_mat`). Read about the FPOP algorithm in [Maidstone et al 2016](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-016-9636-3?wt_mc%3Dinternal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst) for more info. When you are done with your implementation, check your work by comparing with the output of `Segmentor3IsBack::Segmentor(model=1)`. Perform model selection yourself for a range of penalty parameters. Using `testthat`, write some test cases which make sure your function gives the same exact model as the corresponding selected Segmentor model.

### Hard
There is not yet an regularized isotonic regression solver for the normal loss ([issue](https://github.com/tdhock/coseg/issues/3)), and your goal in this test is to implement one. Like the unconstrained model described the Medium test, the regularized isotonic regression model also has only one state. So you can start by modifying the Medium test code, which should have a `cost_model_mat` which is N x 1. However the isotonic regression constraint means that all changes are non-decreasing, so you should use `set_to_min_less_of` instead of `set_to_unconstrained_min_of`. Now the difficult part: the existing code in the `coseg` package implements the Poisson loss via `class PoissonLossPieceLog`, but you need to implement another class for the Normal loss, `NormalLossPiece`. This class will need to declare different coefficients `Constant`, `Linear`, `Quadratic` for a function f(mean)=Constant + Linear*mean + Quadratic*mean^2. You will need to provide implementations for `get_smaller_root` and `get_larger_root` by using the `sqrt` function in `#include <math.h>`. It will be judged even better if you can get `PoissonLossPieceLog` and `NormalLossPiece` to inherit from the same base class with shared methods (that is the approach that the Segmentor package uses to implement several loss functions, and that is the approach that will be recommended for this GSOC project). Check your work by writing a `testthat` unit test to make sure that the model returned by your function with penalty=0 is the same as the model returned by the `isoreg` function (PAVA algorithm). Write another test that checks that the output model is the same as `Fpop` (when all changes are non-decreasing).
